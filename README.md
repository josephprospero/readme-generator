# Joseph Prospero's README.md Generator

## Description
Hello! This is my README.md Generator. This tool is to help developers quickly generate README.md files for the projects in a clean cut, uniform format. It is run completely through VS Code. In order to generate a README, it prompts the user with questions in order to fill out, giving information that needs to be presented on their README. I used JavaScript, Node, and NPM.
